# Atlas Current Logging Board

## Summary

The Atlas Current Logging Board provides the ability to accurately measure and log the current of eight power lines concurrently. Each current measurement module consists of a four-terminal resistor and INA180A1 current sense resistor. Each amplifier outputs its current measurement to a multiplexer which cycles through the inputs at a given sample rate. An LCD display can display live readings and/or configuration settings. A microSD card can be used to archive current logs.
